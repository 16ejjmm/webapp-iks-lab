# 1- Hands-on lab Training webapp-iks-lab

Deploy a Scalable Web App on IKS cluster Workshop 

The purpose of this structured, no-cost, hands-on, instructor-led learning 
experience is to demonstrate how to combine different technologies such 
as Container Orchestration Platform, Container Registry, and cloud 
computing environment to kickstart cloud native applications. Specifically, 
the attendees will learn how to: 

Scaffold a starter web application, run it locally in a container, push the 
scaffolded code to a private Git repository

Deploy the application to a Red Hat OpenShift cluster on IBM Cloud

Monitor the health and performance of the application 

Auto-scale and manually scale the application
It is our goal that attendees will benefit from the workshop through the use of
Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud to enable them to:

Build, deploy, manage, and sale applications faster and more cost-
effectively

Collaborate and accelerate their journey from proof of concept to
